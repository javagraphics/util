/** This is a never-ending iterator that randomly roams over
 * several elements.
 * <P>More specifically: this shuffles all the original elements
 * into a list, and then iterates over that shuffled order.  Once
 * the end is reached, the list is re-shuffled until the first element
 * is not the last element returned.  This way every element will at
 * least get reached once before we randomize everything again.
